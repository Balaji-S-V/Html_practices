<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to
harbor life. While large volumes of water
can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water.
About 71% of Earth's surface is made up
of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29% of
Earth's surface is land, consisting of
continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving
tectonic plates, interacting to produce
mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes.</p>
<p>Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes Earth's
magnetosphere, deflecting destructive solar winds.Earth's atmosphere consists
mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar
energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by
atmospheric and ocean circulation.
Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere and forms clouds that cover most
of the planet.
Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide (CO2) trap a part of the
energy from the Sun close to the surface.
A region's climate is governed by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to
moderating oceans. Severe weather, such
as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and
greatly impacts life.</p>
